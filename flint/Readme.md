This project repo will be for a collaborative project with my brother, an Architect based in Flint, MI. He is heavily involved in the local community applying his expertise in Urban Development. I hope to be able to apply my skills in in data science to help create fully featured investigations of land use in Flint as they recover from the water crisis and economic downturn of the mid-00's.
