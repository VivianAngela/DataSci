##Project Outline

###Satellite Imagery & Deep Learning
Due to the recent water crisis in Flint, MI, there is a wealth of GIS data for the city. I have recently completed some online courses in deep learning and I am researching various projects that use deep learning on satellite imagery. I have found several articles that pertain to segmentation of satellite images of urban areas (cities). I think I can tweak a couple of these examples into something that will be useful for our purposes. If nothing else, it will be a great exercise that should drive home the adapting and development of a deep learning model for satellite imagery using the PyTorch framework.

###Resources
Kurt has provided me with a handful of resources that should provide a great jumping off point for this project.
