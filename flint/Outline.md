##Project Outline

###Satellite Imagery & Deep Learning
Due to the recent water crisis in Flint, MI, there is a wealth of GIS data for the city. I have recently completed some online courses in deep learning and I am researching various projects that use deep learning on satellite imagery. I have found several articles that pertain to semantic segmentation of satellite images of urban areas (cities). I think I can tweak a couple of these examples into something that will be useful for our purposes. If nothing else, it will be a great exercise that should drive home the adapting and development of a deep learning model for satellite imagery using the PyTorch framework.

Using semantic segmentation, I hope to categorize the city and gain some insight into how Flint compares to other major cities. From there, maybe we can find some ways to optimize the layout & zoning of the land as they redevelop. 

###Resources
Kurt has provided me with a handful of resources that should provide a great jumping off point for this project.

[Genesee County Land Bank](http://www.thelandbank.org)
[Flint Property Portal](https://www.flintpropertyportal.org)
[National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)](https://www.nrel.gov/)

I still need to do some research on these sites, but I have a feeling there's a ton of great information.
